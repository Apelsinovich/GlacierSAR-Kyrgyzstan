# Through the Radar Looking Glass: Revealing Earth Processes with SAR  
## NASA Hackathon 2025 — Ala-Archa Glaciers Melting & Impact on Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan

---

## 1. Project Overview

We use SAR data to monitor and forecast glacier melt in the Ala-Archa gorge, which is fed by multiple glaciers including Adigine, Ak-Sai, Golubina, Toktogul, Big Ala-Archa, Small Ala-Archa, and others.  

**Approach:**  
- Analyze historical melt patterns and predict future changes  
- Generate time-series visualizations and graphs showing melt rates  
- Model impacts on the gorge’s river, water resources, floods, and nearby communities  
- Explore how this methodology could be adapted to other glacial systems  

**Impact:**  
- Demonstrates HOW glaciers in the Ala-Archa region are melting and the resulting effects on water supply and local hazards  
- Supports authorities and planners in disaster mitigation and strategic decision-making  
- Raises awareness of glacier melt and climate impacts in the region, providing actionable insights for scientists and communities

## 4. Project Details

**How it works:**  
1. Collect SAR data for Ala-Archa Gorge glaciers  
2. Preprocess and analyze the data  
3. Visualize changes and generate reports on melt rates and potential risks  

**Goals:**  
- Detect glacier boundaries and melting zones  
- Quantify melt rates and forecast future changes  
- Assess risks for water, electricity, and public safety  
- Provide actionable insights for researchers and authorities
