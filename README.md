# Kyrgyzstan-Glacier-Monitoring-SAR  

**TengriSpacers repository for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 — “Through the Radar Looking Glass: Revealing Earth Processes with SAR”.**  
Our focus is on monitoring glacier retreat in Kyrgyzstan using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data.  

---

## 🌍 Project Overview  
Glaciers in the Tien Shan mountains are retreating rapidly, threatening water security, hydropower, and ecosystems in Central Asia.  
By applying **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** data analysis, we aim to reveal glacier changes that are often invisible to traditional optical methods due to clouds and night-time conditions.  

This project combines **Earth observation datasets, SAR analysis techniques, and visualization tools** to provide insights into glacier melt and its impacts on local and global scales.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Detect and monitor **glacier retreat** in Kyrgyzstan using SAR time series.  
- Compare SAR with optical data for validation (Sentinel-2, Landsat).  
- Provide **interactive visualizations** (maps, StoryMaps, dashboards).  
- Assess **local impacts** (water resources, hazards like glacial lake outburst floods).  
- Highlight **global significance** (contribution to climate models, water security).

---

## 🔬 Expected Results  
- **Glacier retreat maps** (SAR-based) for selected regions of Kyrgyzstan.  
- **Time series visualizations** showing retreat over the past decade.  
- **Interactive dashboard / StoryMap** for public and policymakers.  
- Recommendations for local authorities on monitoring and adaptation strategies.  

---

## 🌐 Local & Global Impact
