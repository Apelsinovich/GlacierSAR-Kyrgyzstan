# SAR Glacier Monitoring Report
## Ala-Archa Glaciers, Kyrgyzstan
### NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

---

## 1. Study Area
- **Location**: Ala-Archa Gorge
- **Coordinates**: 42.565°N, 74.5°E
- **Glaciers Monitored**: Adigine, Ak-Sai, Golubina, Toktogul, Big Ala-Archa, Small Ala-Archa

## 2. Data and Methodology

### SAR Data Specifications
- **Satellite**: Sentinel-1
- **Polarization**: VV (recommended for glacier monitoring)
- **Product Type**: GRD
- **Time Period**: 2020-01-01 to 2025-10-04

### Why VV Polarization?
VV (Vertical transmit, Vertical receive) polarization is recommended for glacier monitoring because:
- **High sensitivity** to ice surface changes and roughness
- **Penetration depth** allows detection of sub-surface features
- **Snow water content** estimation capabilities
- **Melt detection** through backscatter changes
- **Consistent performance** across different glacier types

Alternative: HH polarization can be used for complementary information, and full polarimetric data (HH+HV+VH+VV) provides the most comprehensive analysis.

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Radiometric calibration to Sigma0
   - Lee filter for speckle reduction
   - Terrain correction using SRTM 1Sec HGT

2. **Glacier Detection**:
   - Thresholding method
   - Morphological operations for boundary refinement

3. **Change Detection**:
   - Image differencing
   - Ratio analysis
   - Statistical significance testing

4. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Area quantification
   - Trend analysis
   - Melt rate estimation

## 3. Results

### Analysis Summary

### Melt Rate Estimation
- **Annual melt rate**: -0.000 km²/year (-0.00%/year)
- **Total change**: -0.000 km² (-0.00%)
- **Statistical confidence**: R² = 0.810, p-value = 0.0375

### Multi-temporal Comparisons


#### 2020-06-01 vs 2021-06-01
- Mean change: 0.05 dB
- Areas with significant decrease: 13.28%
- Areas with significant increase: 14.02%

#### 2021-06-01 vs 2022-06-01
- Mean change: 0.06 dB
- Areas with significant decrease: 13.24%
- Areas with significant increase: 14.05%

#### 2022-06-01 vs 2023-06-01
- Mean change: 0.05 dB
- Areas with significant decrease: 13.29%
- Areas with significant increase: 13.96%

#### 2023-06-01 vs 2024-06-01
- Mean change: 0.05 dB
- Areas with significant decrease: 13.27%
- Areas with significant increase: 14.02%

## 4. Interpretation

### Backscatter Changes and Glacier Melting
- **Decrease in backscatter** (negative dB change): May indicate:
  - Surface melting and water accumulation
  - Increased moisture content
  - Change from dry to wet snow
  - Glacier surface smoothing

- **Increase in backscatter** (positive dB change): May indicate:
  - Freezing of melt water
  - Surface roughening
  - Snow accumulation
  - Exposed ice surfaces

### Seasonal Considerations
- **Spring/Summer**: Expect decreased backscatter due to melting
- **Fall/Winter**: Expect increased backscatter due to freezing

## 5. Impact Assessment

### Water Resources
- Glacier melt contributes to river flow in Ala-Archa gorge
- Changes affect water availability for Bishkek region
- Peak melt season impacts downstream communities

### Hazard Assessment
- Rapid melt can lead to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs)
- Changes in melt patterns affect river discharge variability
- Long-term glacier loss threatens sustainable water supply

## 6. Recommendations

1. **Continue Monitoring**: Regular SAR acquisitions for time series analysis
2. **Ground Validation**: Field measurements to validate SAR observations
3. **Multi-sensor Integration**: Combine with optical data and climate models
4. **Early Warning System**: Develop alerts for rapid change detection
5. **Community Engagement**: Share findings with local authorities and planners
